**Supply Chain Performance Analysis (Python + Power BI)**

This project presents a complete analysis of supply chain efficiency, delivery performance, delays, customer behavior, and product revenue using the DataCo Supply Chain Dataset.
It includes a 3-page Power BI dashboard that helps identify operational problems, uncover root causes, and highlight customer–product impact.

**🚀 Project Objectives**

1.Measure delivery performance using KPIs.
2.Identify delay patterns across regions, products, and shipping modes.
3.Discover root causes behind high shipping delays.
4.Understand which product categories and regions drive revenue.
5.Analyze how delays impact customer spending and value.

**📊 Dashboard Pages Overview**
**📌 Page 1 — Supply Chain Performance Overview**
This page gives a high-level summary using KPIs and delay insights.

**Key KPIs**
1.On-Time Delivery %: ~42.7%
2.Total Orders: 181K
3.Average Lead Time: 4 days
4.Average Shipping Delay: 0.6 days

**Visuals**
1.Shipping Delay by Region
2.Shipping Delay by Shipping Mode
3.Delivery Status Distribution
4.On-Time Delivery % by Category

**Insights**
1.Less than half of all orders are delivered on time → major efficiency gap.
2.Second Class shipping mode has the highest delay risk.
3.Africa & Asia face the longest delays.
4.Most categories deliver only 40–50% on time.

**📌 Page 2 — Root Cause Analysis**
This page explores why delays occur.

**Visuals**
1.Map of Shipping Delay by Region
2.Delay Risk by Shipping Mode
3.Delay by Product Category
4.Category Table with Lead Time, Delay & On-Time %

**Insights**
1.Delay patterns are global, not region-specific.
2.First & Second Class shipping modes cause most delays.
3.Outdoor & Sporting categories show the highest processing delays.
4.High-volume markets like US & Europe still face similar delays (~0.5–0.7 days).
5.Delays are driven mostly by shipping mode + product type, not customer location.

**📌 Page 3 — Customer & Product Impact**
This page focuses on business value and how delays impact revenue.

**Visuals**
1.Treemap: Sales by Product Category
2.Scatter Plot: Shipping Delay vs Customer Sales
3.Sales per Customer by Region
4.KPI Cards for Sales, Avg Sales/Customer & Late-Delivery Risk

**Insights**
1.High-revenue categories include Fishing, Cleats, Cardio Equipment, Water Sports.
2.Western Europe, Central America & South America have strongest customer value.
3.Higher delay risk = lower customer spending (correlation visible on scatter plot).
4.Customers with longer delays consistently spend less and have lower repeat orders.

**📁 Files Included**
1.PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix — full interactive dashboard
2.Dashboard Screenshots
3.README.md — project documentation
4.Untitled(1) - Python notebook

**📥 Dataset Source**
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:

**🛠 Tools & Skills Used**
Power BI
DAX Measures
Data Cleaning
KPI Design
Data Visualization
Supply Chain Analytics
Customer Segmentation
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Exploratory data analysis

**🧾 Conclusion**
The supply chain suffers from:
1.Shipping mode inefficiencies
2.Category-specific delay issues
3.Global logistics bottlenecks
4.Revenue impact due to delays

**Improving Second Class shipping, optimizing handling time, and better regional logistics planning can significantly boost delivery performance and customer value.
